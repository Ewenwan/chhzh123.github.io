I am a senior undergraduate in the [School of Data and Computer Science](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm), ranking the 1st out of 188 students in the department with GPA 3.90/4.00 (Major GPA: 4.00/4.00). I conduct research under the supervision of Dr. [Minghua Shen](https://ceca.pku.edu.cn/people/alumni_postgrad/class2017g/1206157.htm) and Prof. [Nong Xiao](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/content/2484) in [National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou (NSCC-GZ)](http://en.nscc-gz.cn/index.html). I work as a remote intern supervised by Prof. [Zhiru Zhang](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~zhiruz/index.html) at [Computer Systems Laboratory](https://zhang.ece.cornell.edu/), Cornell University in the summer of 2020. At present, I am a research intern in [Bytedance AI Lab](https://ailab.bytedance.com/), advised by Jun He and [Yibo Zhu](http://yibozhu.com/).

My research interests cover **computer systems and architecture**, especially domain-specific compilers, runtime systems, and accelerators for graph processing and machine learning. I also spend a long time working on high-level synthesis (HLS) for field-programmable gate array (FPGA). I attempt to bridge the gap between different software applications and hardware, and make applications run more efficiently via systematic methodologies.

Moreover, I organize a [seminar](/seminar) on common tools for computer engineering, and you can find more details [here](/seminar).
